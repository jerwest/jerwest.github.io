Individual Assignment #2

For this assignment, you will create an HTML page that contains a form, and a PHP script that will process the form data and display it back to the user. 

For your HTML page, your page should include:
- A form element containing text entry fields for the following information:

- Name (*Required)
- Email (*Required)
- Phone Number 
- State of Residence 

- There should be data validation enforcing required fields be filled in BEFORE submission. (Pro tip, Javascript is your friend here)
- Fields not marked required can be submitted blank. 

For your PHP script:
- The form data entered in the html should be sent via GET method. 
- Your PHP script should echo the data back to the user in the following format:

Name : <User entered data>
Email: <User entered data>
Phone : <User entered data, if no user entered data, do not show this line>
State: <User entered data, if no user entered data, do not show this line>

Please create a github repository named AD320-IA2-<lastname>, and submit a link to the repository.
